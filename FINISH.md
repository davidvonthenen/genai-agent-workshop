# Workshop Complete: Kubernetes AI Agent with DigitalOcean GenAI

Congratulations on completing the **Kubernetes AI Agent Workshop**! ðŸŽ‰ You've built and deployed a powerful AI agent that can act as a Kubernetes Subject Matter Expert (SME). This workshop equipped you with the skills to:

- Utilize DigitalOcean's GenAI platform to create and manage a Knowledge Base.
- Deploy an AI Agent using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
- Embed the chatbot into a webpage for user interaction.
- Programmatically interact with your agent via API calls.

We hope this workshop has inspired you to explore the possibilities of AI-powered applications!
