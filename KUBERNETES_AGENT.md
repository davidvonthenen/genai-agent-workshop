# Welcome to the DigitalOcean GenAI Platform Workshop: Kubernetes AI Agent

In this workshop, weâ€™ll guide you through deploying a **Kubernetes AI Agent** using DigitalOcean's GenAI Platform. The goal is to create a **Subject Matter Expert (SME)** that can assist with managing Kubernetes clusters, including tasks like installation, configuration, troubleshooting, and scaling.

This hands-on session will demonstrate how to integrate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and large language models (LLMs) to build an intelligent agent designed specifically for Kubernetes.

## Why Build a Kubernetes AI Agent?

Managing Kubernetes clusters can be complex, requiring knowledge of container orchestration, networking, storage, and monitoring. An AI agent specialized in Kubernetes can:

- Provide instant troubleshooting guidance.
- Help with commands and configurations.
- Automate repetitive tasks.
- Serve as a knowledge base for Kubernetes best practices.

By the end of this workshop, you'll have a fully functional Kubernetes AI Agent deployed on DigitalOcean's GenAI platform.

## Workshop Goals

- Deploy a GenAI Agent tailored for Kubernetes management.
- Customize the agent with function calling.
- Utilize DigitalOcean's GenAI infrastructure to deploy, test, and scale your agent.

Optionally, you can also modify this AI Agent to include:

- your own organizations configuration guides or best-practices
- any operational runbooks for managing Kubernetes in your organization
